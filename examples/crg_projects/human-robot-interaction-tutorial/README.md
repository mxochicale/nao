[Youtube-Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT8rNQEs-_w) of https://twitter.com/RobotPhilip
where he explains how to use the speech recognition tool with three gestures in Choregraphe.


Lauch choregraphe
```
$cd ~/naosoftware/choregraphe-suite-2.1.4.13-linux64

```
and follow the tutorial or load the already pml project file.
