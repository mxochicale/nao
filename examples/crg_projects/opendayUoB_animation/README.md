Vertical Arm Movements
---

The following **pml** projects were my first examples of animations with NAO
which performs vertical arm movements using an animation with loop block.

* openday00_naoqi21413/
Version 00 only say hello

* openday01_naoqi21413/
Version 01 say: "hello can you replicate the following arm movements?"


Both were tested on a machine with Ubuntu 16.04 x64 on Fri 12 May 19:29:57 BST 2017
