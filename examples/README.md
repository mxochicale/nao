# Exporting animations to python


These are some simple instructions on how to use the examples for the exporting animations
to python.


1. Turn on NAO humanoid robot, and once you heard “OGNAK GNOUK” is ready to use.
That is the boot process of NAO which takes 2minutes 13 seconds

2. Establish the network connection with NAO by connecting the ethernet cable to 
both nao's head and the machine where you run the script.
Go to the network and select NAO and then you will get that the connection has been
stablished.

You can run a quit test by going to this path and run ```testingNAO.py``` as follows
```
cd /home/map479/mxochicale/github/nao/examples/exporting_animations_to_python/python_scripts
./testingNAO.py
```
which shake left arm in front, then open close hand of NAO.


3. For the main animation examples, go to this path and execute the following commands.
**NOTE** becareful with the base of NAO as it can be unstable and NAO can fell down.

```
cd ~/mxochicale/github/nao/examples/exporting_animations_to_python/python_scripts
./SixUpperArmMovements.py
```

4. Turnning NAO off. Make sure NAO is in a safe position and press the Chest button for 
3 seconds, until NAO says "GNUK GNUK". The shutdown process takes approximately 18 seconds.
