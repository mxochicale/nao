NAO Robot Demos for STEM Robotics Education  Colorado School of Mines  

Client:  Dr. Hao Zhang
Project Team:  John Spielvogel, Austin Leo, Zach Smialek, Jacob Maerli


Programs   written   for   the   NAO   robot   can   be   executed   using   two   different  
frameworks:   Choregraphe   and   the   Robot   Operating   System   (ROS).
ROS   is   a   commandÂ­line   based   framework   which   provides   no   GUI   and   has   a  
much   steeper   learning   curve   than   Choregraphe.
