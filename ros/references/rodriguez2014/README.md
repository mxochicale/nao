Dear Igor*,

Your paper "Humanizing NAO robot teleoperation using ROS"  
is very education for which I want to learn more about it with the code at  
[github.com/rsait/NAO_ROS]. However, it is not available anymore.
It's possible that you provide the source code or any other source.
It might also be useful if you mention what ROS distribution are you using
and the Linux Distribution as well.
